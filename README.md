# Numericals
In this repository I will try to add standard numericals of conceptual questions in data science like statistics , linear algebra , deep learning , Graphical Algorithms , natural lanuage processing etc etc 
I hope it is helpful for others who are looking for solutions or similar questions .
I will also be mentioning  my understanding and the part where I got stuck along with detailed explanation of the confusion creating parts in the questions .
